# Where are data analysts working from? A country analysis
![Image](https://baunsreit.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/data_analysts.png)
###Motivation :blush:
*This is my first project within the Ironhack Analytics Bootcamp (Part time version) in Madrid.*

###Overview :earth_africa:
The result of this project is to analyse how **data-related analysts** are working **depending on their location (countryside or urban)** and analyse these patterns according to the country they're living in. **You will also be able to download a CSV with the requested table** or even **analyse the results per country**, too.

### Data sources :scroll:
 - Database with the job codes and the demographic information
    - Provided by [Ironhack](http://www.potacho.com/files/ironhack/raw_data_project_m1.db) formatted as a `.db` file.
 - API access to Swagger data created by [Work Data Initiative](http://api.dataatwork.org/v1/jobs/autocomplete?contains=data
)
 - Scraping the country codes from [Eurostat](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Glossary:Country_codes)

###Country analysis :crystal_ball:
The following outputs will be available for you to download as a `.csv` 
- Download the csv table with all the countries analysed and the representative percentage
- Download the csv table with only one country analysed

In order to analyse the country of your choice, you can choose from the following table, scraped from [Eurostat](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Glossary:Country_codes)
- Austria
- Belgium
- Bulgaria
- Croatia
- Cyprus
- Czechia
- Denmark
- Estonia
- Finland
- France
- Germany
- Greece
- Hungary
- Ireland
- Italy
- Latvia
- Lithuania
- Luxembourg
- Malta
- Netherlands
- Poland
- Portugal
- Romania
- Slovakia
- Slovenia
- Spain
- Sweden
- United Kingdom

###How to use: :electric_plug:
Run the main_scrip.py in your terminal to check the results. You can either run the script indicating the path selected or you can either select a country of your choice and get the `.csv`  file with the country input.

###Country analysis: Spain example :tada:
An example of the input that you will be able to retrieve is the following:

###Next steps :telescope:
- Building a function that will retrieve visualisations for the data analysed
- Be able to send the output automatised by email
